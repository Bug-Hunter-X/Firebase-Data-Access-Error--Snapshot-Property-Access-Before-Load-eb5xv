The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded. This often happens when using asynchronous operations and not properly handling promises. For example, if you fetch data with `get()` and immediately try to access the data, it might lead to an error because the data is not yet available.
